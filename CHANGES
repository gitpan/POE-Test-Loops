  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    Time for an official release.

  2009-03-02 00:06:17 (r2487) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    New test release.

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    Remove the specific dependency on version 0.74, and pray that the
    user has a recent enough version

  2009-03-01 13:31:26 (r2477) by apocal
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_tail.pm M

    I was overzealous, this test works in Strawberry Perl, not
    ActiveState...

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/connect_errors.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_tail.pm M

    more tweaks to get the tests to SKIP on buggy MSWin32 perls :(

  2009-03-01 08:21:04 (r2475) by apocal
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_accept.pm M

    tweak the test so it passes on MSWin32+ActiveState 5.6.1

  2009-02-25 08:09:16 (r2468) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    Time for a new release.

  poe-test-loops/Makefile.PL M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    use version.pm so our version comparison is more robust and supports
    developer releases too 

  2009-02-22 19:37:04 (r2459) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    Time for a new DEVELOPER release.

  2009-02-22 19:25:46 (r2458) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    Time for a new release.

  2009-02-17 12:27:29 (r2453) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    remove spurious warns

  2009-02-17 11:20:27 (r2452) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_readline.pm M

    match up missing brace 

  2009-02-17 11:18:59 (r2451) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    only run the object/package state tests if we have a new enough POE

  poe/lib/POE/Wheel/ReadLine.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/wheel_readline.pm M

    Resolve rt.cpan.org #38974, reported by Jari Bonte. If TERM is
    misset, we will skip the POE::Wheel::ReadLine test rather than fail. 

  2009-02-16 11:23:16 (r2444) by apocal
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/sbk_signal_init.pm M

    skip test because of broken alarm() on MSWin32 with perl5.6

  2009-02-16 10:34:12 (r2440) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    use object and package_states in NFA tests to make sure it works 

  2009-02-10 09:05:42 (r2426) by rcaputo

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_session.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/ses_nfa.pm M

    Remove some warnings.

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/bin/poe-gen-tests M

    Apply Tony Cook's suggestion to use environment variables to skip
    problematic tests. Event loops which have these problems can bypass
    tests which are known to fail. Also fixed a documentation omission
    based on his comments in IRC.

    New release!

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/connect_errors.pm A;
  poe-test-loops/MANIFEST M

    Add Tony Cook's test for connect() errors. Some loops regster connect
    errors differently than other I/O, such as POE::XS::Loop::Poll. This
    covers the new condition. Resolves rt.cpan.org #37393. 

  2008-07-04 20:41:20 (r2375) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/bin/poe-gen-tests M

    Invert the sense for the sample skip-network-tests questin. Resolves
    rt.cpan.org #36277 submitted by Tony Cook.

  2008-06-28 21:33:14 (r2372) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    oops, we really do need this. 

  2008-06-28 20:46:33 (r2371) by rcaputo
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops/k_alarms.pm M

    Fix a package indexer error.

    Doc cleanups. 

  2008-06-28 09:43:21 (r2367) by lotr
  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M

    document generate() and mark the other functions as private

  poe-test-loops/lib/POE/Test/Loops.pm M;
  poe-test-loops/bin/poe-gen-tests M

    rearrange code
    
    put all the logic from poe-gen-tests in POE::Test::Loops, so it can
    be used from other modules without needing to execute poe-gen-tests.

    Bump the version to 0.98.
